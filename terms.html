      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="page-meta">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

      <p>These Terms of Use govern your use of the Set mobile application. By downloading or using Set, you agree to these terms.</p>

      <h2>Description of Service</h2>
      <p>Set is a strength-training log application for iOS. It allows you to record workout data, track lift progression, and calculate training percentages. Set is provided as a free application during the beta period.</p>

      <h2>Use of the App</h2>
      <p>You may use Set for personal, non-commercial purposes. You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the application</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the app or its systems</li>
        <li>Use the app in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations</li>
        <li>Distribute, license, or sell the app or any derivative works</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Data</h2>
      <p>You retain ownership of all data you enter into Set. The app stores data locally on your device and optionally in your personal iCloud account. We do not claim any rights to your training data. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on data handling.</p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The Set app, including its design, code, logo, and content, is protected by intellectual property laws. The "Set" name and logo are proprietary. Nothing in these terms grants you rights to use our trademarks or branding.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>Set is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not warrant that the app will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. Training data calculations (including 1RM estimates and percentage computations) are approximations and should not be relied upon as precise measurements.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of Set. This includes, without limitation, any injuries sustained during training, data loss, or inability to access the app.</p>

      <h2>Health Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Set is a data logging tool, not a fitness or medical advisor. Always consult qualified professionals before beginning or modifying any exercise program. Training with weights carries inherent risks. Use estimated maxes and percentages as general guidance only.</p>

      <h2>Apple's Standard EULA</h2>
      <p>Your use of Set is also subject to Apple's Licensed Application End User License Agreement, available at Apple's website. In the event of a conflict between these terms and Apple's EULA, Apple's terms govern to the extent of the conflict.</p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to discontinue Set at any time. You may stop using the app at any time by deleting it from your device. Your locally stored data remains on your device until you delete it.</p>

      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of Set after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. Material changes will be communicated through the app or on this page.</p>
